            "Our apartment is located in the beautiful Palais Bellevue building. Palais Bellevue was originally constructed in 1858 to cater to the many English tourists who had begun to discover the delights of this sleepy fishing village. When you step inside the marble lobby, it is easy to imagine a string quartet playing in the corner, whilst fashionable tourists stroll around the grounds, taking in the beautiful surroundings and sea air.",
            "During the war, the building was converted to a hospital for wounded soldiers. Around 1948 work began to convert the building into the apartment building it is today. Many of the apartments are still held by family of the original owners.",
            "Our apartment is located on the 1st floor. It can be reached either by a marble staircase or via an elevator. We totally renovated the apartment in 2017, knocking down some interior walls to allow more light and better flow. At the same time, we were very careful to keep all of the original features - the marble fireplaces and beautiful period radiators and daddo rails.",
            "The apartment has two bedrooms with king sized beds that can both be split into singles. We can sleep up to 4 people comfortably. We have a fully stocked kitchen with dishwasher, induction hob, full size oven, fridge, washing machine and Nespresso coffee maker. The marble bathroom has a rainforest shower as well as a hand held shower and marble vanity.",
            "The living room has a flat screen tv, comfortable couch and footstool. We have very fast fibre optic broadband internet and a desk in the bedroom if you need to work.",
            "A balcony is accessed from both the living room and main bedroom. A perfect place to sit and enjoy the sea views and spectacular sunsets whilst enjoying a local bottle of rose."
