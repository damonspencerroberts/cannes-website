Tastefully furnished and well appointed (with an eat in fully functioning kitchen) the apartment has lovely views overlooking  manicured gardens to the sparkling waters of the Mediterranean.  A short walk to the ocean promenade and beachside cafes and boulangeries. In walking distance of the old town. It was lovely to sit on the balcony, drink rose and relax whilst admiring the view.",
